"What I think about why people would hesitate to invest more in blockchain than AI, and I'm not against it, I'm just thinking about what could be difficult, is that the volatility of the crypto is really high.",CX,General complexity,p.11,P1
"So it's kind of a very volatile market, which is a good profit opportunity, but not all people think about it like that.",CP,Market/org context [Context] [Context],p.11,P1
"So since the risk is really high, it makes it also more difficult compared to AI.",CX,General complexity,p.11,P1
"So what I meant is that if I needed to make a transaction with the shop, for example, the moment I'm able to make a transaction using coins, crypto, is the moment that it will be more impactful in life.",PU,General usefulness,p.13,P1

"It's like, you know, like in some countries, would push people to use cash more because they have an advantage of using cash than a card.",RA,General advantage,p.15,P1

"And I also believe since it started to be a trend, everyone wants to jump at it, and also how much it costs to enter, comparing to how much it costs.",RA,Cost & efficiency,p.9,P1
"For example, if you are doing an AI solution, building technology, it will not cost you as much as if you are doing something with crypto, because it's more complicated.",RA,Cost & efficiency,p.9,P1
"And so the amount of money needed is less, comparing to crypto, and then it's easy to go to the market.",PEOU,Ease of use/UI [Context],p.9,P1

"We already have this information, but what Colin's trying to say is that we'll have a flag, we'll make it much easier for this information to be reflected on the main record itself.",TR,General trialability,p.45,P3
"And then eventually the end goal will be an aggregation of these different licensees up into a legal entity, which will make your life a lot easier, Salvatore, because we know it's hard to group under one specific entity.",CX,Learning curve [Regulation],p.45,P3
"Yeah, and hopefully once the acquisition goes through, we can get going on your integration efforts.",CP,Integration with legacy systems,p.48,P3
"Which is exactly what we're working towards, something like a metadata tag which would say this is the mica licensee, this is the EMI licensee, and in that respect you'd then be able to grab them.",OB,General observability [Regulation],p.50,P3
"We've seen it available in the regulator at least a week or two beforehand, and it's on our system.",OB,General observability [Regulation],p.51,P3
"It's the standard information that's required, but they are specified in the legislation that needs to be made available, and then it's at the discretion of the regulator to make it more information available, which is what we've seen.",OB,General observability [Regulation],p.52,P3

"We have to have, as you guys have, a business case for a product.",PU,Business value/ROI,p.100,P5
"And let's say it costs us number X for getting the data, number Y for the personal cost to integrate it in our system, number Z for the system cost, and so on.",RA,Cost & efficiency,p.100,P5
And then we have a number of what our annual costs will be to have the product in the market.,RA,Cost & efficiency [Context],p.100,P5

"I think there's efficiency as well, as long as I'm not mining it.",RA,Cost & efficiency,p.107,P7
"I think mining is time consuming, but as I understand it, digital ledger technology and tokenization actually makes things, you know, a faster.",RA,Speed & settlement,p.107,P7
"It gets quite complex, so I suppose it would be easier with digital ledger technology.",CX,Technical complexity,p.108,P7
